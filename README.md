# Love Maths

Love Maths is a simple JavaScript project I created to experiment with using the **DOM**, event handling, and basic logic in the browser.

## 🎯 What the App Does

The app presents the user with a randomly generated maths question based on the selected operation:

- ➕ **Addition**
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division**

The user enters their answer, and the app:

- Checks if the answer is correct  
- Displays feedback  
- Updates the **Correct** or **Incorrect** score counters  

It’s a fun way to practise basic arithmetic while also demonstrating DOM manipulation and interactive UI updates.

## 🧪 Tech Used

- **HTML** – structure  
- **CSS** – styling  
- **JavaScript** – logic, event listeners, DOM manipulation  

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

This app was built as a learning exercise to improve my understanding of:

- Querying and updating DOM elements  
- Handling user input  
- Working with random number generation  
- Updating UI state dynamically  

It’s a simple project, but a great hands-on way to explore the fundamentals of interactive JavaScript.
